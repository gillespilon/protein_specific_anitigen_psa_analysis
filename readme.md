# Protein-specific antigen (PSA) analysis

## In brevi

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is produced for the ejaculate, where it liquifies the semen in the seminal coagulum and allows sperm to swim freely (Balk et.al. 2003). PSA is present in small quantities in the serum of men with healthy prostates, but is often elevated in the presence of prostate cancer or other prostate disorders (Catalona et.al. 1994).
